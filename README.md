## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-entertainment.git
   cd my-entertainment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance.
